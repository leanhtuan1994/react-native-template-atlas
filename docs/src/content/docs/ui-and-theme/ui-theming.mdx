How we manage the UI and theming of the application.

## Why [Uniwind](https://docs.uniwind.dev/) ?

For the past few years, we have tried multiple approaches to style React Native apps: Stylesheet API, styled-components, restyle, and more.

Right now, we are confident that using [Uniwind](https://docs.uniwind.dev/) with React Native is the right solution. Uniwind provides a TailwindCSS-like experience specifically optimized for React Native.

If you are familiar with TailwindCSS on the web, you'll find Uniwind very easy to use, with a similar utility-first approach adapted for React Native's constraints.

Uniwind was a natural choice, considering that many developers come from a web background and have experience with TailwindCSS.

:::tip

If you are not familiar with TailwindCSS, we recommend you read the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) first to understand the utility-first CSS approach.

You may also want to play with the [TailwindCSS playground](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) to get a better understanding of how utility classes work before using them in React Native.

## About Uniwind

Uniwind is a utility-first styling library for React Native that provides a TailwindCSS-like experience. It uses the `className` prop to apply styles directly to React Native components, making it intuitive for developers familiar with TailwindCSS on the web.

Uniwind is designed specifically for React Native and works seamlessly with modern React Native architecture, including the new architecture and Expo.

For more details about Uniwind, check the [official documentation](https://docs.uniwind.dev/).

Here is an example of how your component should look like:

<CodeBlock file="src/components/card.tsx" />

## Configuration

Uniwind follows TailwindCSS configuration patterns, allowing you to customize themes and colors to match your design system.

Like TailwindCSS, you can configure Uniwind through your tailwind.config.js file, customizing colors, spacing, typography, and more.

We have created a `ui/theme` folder where you can find our custom colors that have been imported into `tailwind.config.js` and used as a theme for our demo application. You can add your own color palette and use them in your components with Tailwind class names.

You can read more about how to [configure your project with Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

## Dark Mode

    type="video/mp4"

### Why dark mode?

Dark mode has gained significant traction in recent years and has become an expected feature to have.
By applying dark mode, it makes it easier on the eyes in low-light environments and reduces eye strain, which means more time spent on your app.

This template comes with dark mode support out of the box, and it's very easy to customize the color scheme of your app. Thanks to [TailwindCSS dark mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)

### Implementation

Since we're using Uniwind (which follows TailwindCSS patterns) and expo-router, we let them handle the application of theme, and we just take care of the colors we want.
We set the colors in `ui/theme/colors.js` and we use them in our hook `useThemeConfig.tsx` to get the theme object that we pass to ThemeProvider directly. For more information check out [expo-router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/appearance/)

<CodeBlock file="src/lib/contexts/app-theme-context.tsx" />

<CodeBlock file="src/app/_layout.tsx" />

### How do we handle theme changes?

We use the `loadSelectedTheme` function to load the theme from the storage if there's a theme saved in the storage, otherwise, we let Uniwind use the default theme (system).
To set the selected theme, we use the `useSelectedTheme` hook, which sets the theme in the storage and updates the color scheme of the app.

<CodeBlock file="src/lib/hooks/use-selected-theme.tsx" />

### Add dark mode for each component

To add the values for the light mode, you can simply write them directly in your component class. For the dark mode, you can use the **dark:** variant.

```tsx
<View className="... border-neutral-200 dark:border-yellow-700">....</View>
```

If you want to use the style prop, you can use the `useColorScheme` hook to get the current color scheme and use it to apply the desired style. However, **in most cases, you won't need it** as the dark: variant will do the job.

```tsx
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';

const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
const style =
  colorScheme === 'dark'
    ? { backgroundColor: 'black' }
    : { backgroundColor: 'white' };
```
