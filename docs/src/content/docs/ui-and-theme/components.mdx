# UI Components Documentation Has Moved

This page has been reorganized for better clarity and accuracy.

## New Documentation Structure

The UI Components documentation has been split into two comprehensive guides:

### 1. [HeroUI Native Components](./heroui-native/)

Documentation for the **primary UI component library** used in Atlas starter (v1.0.0-beta.11).

**Includes:**
- 30+ production-ready components (Button, TextField, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- Component variants and styling
- Dark mode support
- Form integration patterns
- 30 interactive component showcases
- Complete API reference

**→ [Go to HeroUI Native Components](./heroui-native/)**

---

### 2. [Custom Components](./custom-components/)

Documentation for the **6 custom components** built specifically for Atlas starter.

**Includes:**
- Image (Uniwind wrapper)
- Text (i18n-enabled)
- ControlledInput (form integration)
- List (FlashList wrapper)
- Modal (bottom sheet)
- FocusAwareStatusBar

**→ [Go to Custom Components](./custom-components/)**

---

## Why the Split?

The previous documentation mixed HeroUI Native components (like Button, Checkbox, Select) with custom components, which created confusion about:

- Which components actually exist in `src/components/ui/`
- Where to import components from (`heroui-native` vs `@/components/ui`)
- What's available in the UI library

The new structure provides:

✅ **Clear separation** between library components and custom components
✅ **Accurate import statements** for each component
✅ **Better organization** with dedicated guides
✅ **Component showcases** documentation (30 interactive examples)

---

## Quick Reference

### Import from `heroui-native`:
```tsx
import {
  Button,
  TextField,
  Card,
  Dialog,
  Checkbox,
  Switch,
  Select,
  Tabs,
  // ... and 20+ more
} from 'heroui-native';
```

### Import from `@/components/ui`:
```tsx
import {
  Image,
  Text,
  View,
  ControlledInput,
  List,
  Modal,
  FocusAwareStatusBar
} from '@/components/ui';
```
